## My process

- I first created the HTML structure based on the contents of the image. 
  - In retrospective, since the larger challenge for me was the repsonsiveness, I'm wondering it maybe next time I should start there even if there's no content yet. Might have solved some of the harder questions first maybe (?). 
- I then went ahead and created some basic naming for the classes and made sure to separate them on the css doc.
- Worked on givign the different styles and colors.
- Finally reviewed the responsiveness, I used grids for this and flexbox for some minor sections inside each of the three sections.
  - Worked first on the mobile version and worked my way up. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I'm particularly worried about if my projects are easy to read and if there's anything I can do to make them more escalable. 


### Useful resources

- [GRID: A simple visual cheatsheet for CSS Grid Layout](https://grid.malven.co) -  I used this cheatsheet for how to use Grids.
- [CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet) - Awesome resource to quickly remember how flexbox works.
- [Beautiful CSS box-shadow examples](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - Great resource to give you quick and easy shadows.
